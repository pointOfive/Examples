# Coding

## Python

## C++

## SQL

I have experience using SQL in `postgreSQL`, `psycopg2`, and `sparkSQL` contexts.
Some example queries are available in the [SQL subdirectory](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/Code/SQL).

## R

I began using R in college,
worked primarily in R during graduate school (except for a year during which I primarily used matlab),
and worked primarily in R during my postdoctoral program and subsequent two work positions --
approximately ten years in total.
As of approximately two years ago I switched over to Python (primarily for access to the scikit-learn library); however,
I am more than comfortable using R if the necessary functionality is not yet available in a Python context.
For example, please see the [R subdirectory](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/Code/SQL) for an analysis
of job salaries using [Model Based Tree Partitioning](http://party.r-forge.r-project.org), a very interesting
methodology for subgroup analysis that has recently received attention in the context of
(causal inference)[http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.full].
