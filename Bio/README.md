# About

## NYC

Last year I had the chance to move to NYC and it was such an exciting opportunity
for adventure and growth that I had to go for it (...a definite must on the ol' life resume...).
The energy and diversity (read, people) of this city are so amazing and
confirmed for me that the sense of pacing and life 
cities provide give me a very vibrant and motivating ingredient in my life.
On the other hand, there's a great sense of peace and accomplishment to be found
in nature. As such, I've really enjoyed living close to Central Park on a quiet(er)
[Upper West Side](https://www.google.com/maps/place/American+Museum+of+Natural+History/@40.7802558,-73.9829629,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f4b00f7a09:0xa27d8172624c5db1!8m2!3d40.7813241!4d-73.9739882) street (near Zabars grocery, the Amerian Museum of Natural History, and Riverside Park).
Central Park (and the Subway System) in Manhattan feel like the best things ever invented -- I am
very appreciative of the opportunity I've had to live in, explore, and enjoy this exciting city. 

## ATX

The opportunity to come to NYC materialized because I had spent the previous year or so
extending my [Bioinformatics/Science skill set](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#hpc)
into a [Data Science/Predictive Methodology skill set](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures).
Despite having a [PhD in Statistics and doing a lot of data analysis](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications),
much of the modern data analysis toolset, (e.g., (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Classification, Big Data, Recommender Systems, Dimensionality Reduction, NLP, etc.)[https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures#lecture-material])
was new(ish) to me.  But picking up these tools never felt "hard" or "foreign" -- they're very comfortable and seemless extensions of my skill set.
Actually, coming back to [scripting and coding](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Code),
[organizing data processing environments](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#aws-ec2emrs3) and
[modeling and analyzing data](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Examples) just felt like returning to my roots -- it was comfortable, exciting, and
nice to be home where I belonged.

## UT

Living in Austin was nice.  It's an easy city to be healthy in -- there's
nice neighborhoods, fun [running paths](http://www.mountainbiketx.com/downloads/texas/maps/Shoal_Creek.pdf), and I always swam several times a week at the
[spring fed pools](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deep+Eddy+Municipal+Pool/@30.2742588,-97.7777817,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644b546480d4c9f:0x36e8599164fc2421!8m2!3d30.276515!4d-97.7732058).
I moved to Austin to be a part of a [Switchgrass (Biofuel Crop) Breeding Program at the University of Texas](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/juenger_lab/home).
I wanted to be a part of, and contribute to a long term research program.
At UT I was a part of an increadibly strong team of postdocs and graduate students with very diverse backgrounds ranging from 
molecular biology, ecology, botony, plant physiology, and field managers to myself (who provided
[Bioinformatic](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#open-source-tools) and
[Statistical](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications) support to the lab).
The combined expertise in the lab comprised a molecular marker based breeding program
with tens of field sites ranging from Mexico to Illinois and 
explored the GxE interactions of plant ecotypes versus environmental conditions.
A really interesting perk of this job were the field days when we'd harvest, collect
samples, and take measurents... I always enjoyed getting out and actually doing the data collection.
Miss those days.

## Growing Up

and the sense of excitement these
things have brought to my own adventure here.
