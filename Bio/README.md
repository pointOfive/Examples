## NYC

Last year I embarked on an exciting adventure/career opportunity, and moved to NYC.
The energy and diversity (read, people) in this city are amazing,
and my experience here has confirmed for me that the sense of pacing and life 
in cities provides a very vibrant and motivating ingredient in my life.
On the other hand, there's a great sense of peace and accomplishment to be found
in nature. And as such, I've really enjoyed living close to [Central Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Central+Park/@40.7438632,-74.0175455,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2589a018531e3:0xb9df1f7387a94119!8m2!3d40.7828647!4d-73.9653551) on a quiet(er)
[Upper West Side](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7851626,-73.9739507,14z) street (near
[Zabars](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zabar's/@40.7848188,-73.984094,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258862e7ae59b:0x161b26b78af02870!8m2!3d40.7848148!4d-73.9797113),
the [AMNH](https://www.google.com/maps/place/American+Museum+of+Natural+History/@40.7802558,-73.9829629,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f4b00f7a09:0xa27d8172624c5db1!8m2!3d40.7813241!4d-73.9739882), and
[Riverside Park](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8027274,-73.9705007,14z)).
Aside from Central Park (which is obviously the best thing a city ever did for itself), I am
unendingly impressed with the efficieny of the [Subway System](http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html) in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City)
(which clearly distinguishes me as a non-native).
I am extremely appreciative of the opportunity I've had to live in, explore, and enjoy this unique city.


## ATX

The opportunity to come to NYC materialized because I had spent the previous year or so
expanding from my [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#hpc) skill set
into [Data Science](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures#lecture-material). 
Despite having a [PhD in Statistics](https://stat.duke.edu/people/scott-l-schwartz) and working in
[data analysis](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications),
much of the modern data analysis toolset
(e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Classification, Big Data, Recommender Systems, Dimensionality Reduction, NLP, etc.)
was new(ish) to me.  But picking up these tools never felt "hard" or "foreign" -- predictive methodology and supporting tools therein
are very comfortable for me and are a seemless and natural extension of my previous training. 
Actually, coming back to [scripting and coding](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Code),
[organizing data processing environments](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#aws-ec2emrs3) and
[modeling and analyzing data](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Examples) just felt like returning to my roots -- it was comfortable, exciting, and
nice to be home where I belonged.

## UT

Living in Austin was good -- 
nice neighborhoods, good [running](http://www.mountainbiketx.com/downloads/texas/maps/Shoal_Creek.pdf), and 
year round 68-degree natural spring [pools](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deep+Eddy+Municipal+Pool/@30.2742588,-97.7777817,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644b546480d4c9f:0x36e8599164fc2421!8m2!3d30.276515!4d-97.7732058).  
I moved to Austin to join the [Switchgrass Biofuel Crop Program](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/juenger_lab/home)
at the [University of Texas](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu)
so I could be a part of, and contribute to a long term research program.
At UT I was a part of an increadibly strong team of postdocs and graduate students with very diverse backgrounds ranging from 
molecular biology, ecology, botony, plant physiology, and field managers to myself (who provided
[Bioinformatic](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#open-source-tools) and
[Statistical](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications) support to the lab).
The combined expertise in the lab comprised a molecular marker based crop development program
with tens of field sites ranging from Mexico to Illinois and 
explored the GxE interactions of plant ecotypes versus environmental conditions.
And the job included the very interesting perk of needing to be an actual plant farmer every now and again
when planting and sample collection season came around.  


## TAMU

Prior to moving to Austin I spent several very enjoyable years in
[College Station, Texas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/College+Station,+TX/@30.5907759,-100.7740924,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8646848619463ca3:0xc969c74db6bf6ac9!8m2!3d30.627977!4d-96.3344068), home of the
[Aggies](https://medium.com/@ln_ib/reload-collected-texas-a-m-aggie-jokes-4f74c2d86f34) of
[Texas A&M University](https://borlaug.tamu.edu).  If you're from Texas you know what Texas A&M is, but it was only
about the time of my arrival that the rest of the country also found out (and that probably had something to do with
[Johnny Football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVxxdFOcQQ), as opposed to my arrival alone).
While at TAMU I worked for the [AgriLife Bioinformatics Services Core](http://www.txgen.tamu.edu)
driving and supporting the adoption of next generation genomic sequencing technology ("nextgen sequencing")
across the academic and industry research community associated with Texas A&M.
This involved providing consultation, contracting, and educational services
regarding Illumina nextgen sequencing platforms and subsequent downstream data processing and analysis
(all of which I learned on the job).
While at A&M I interfaced with a very diverse set of research and application areas,
but I consistently interacted with the agricultural community.
This was a very pleasant and positive experience, showing me a
dimension of Texas that I had never experienced, but also leading to my 
my interest in moving to Austin to join the crop development program at UT.


## Postdoc

The reason I ended up working in genetic sequencing technologies in the first place was because
I found genetic data extremely compelling.
I have always been very "applied" in my orientation and preferred to work on "real world" problems
-- for example, it was the power of small sample sizes in polling that first drew me to data analysis.
But what could be more exciting and promising than working on the data that programs life?
So, without even a single college biology class to my name I joined the 
[Training Program in Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Nutrition and Cancer](https://www.stat.tamu.edu/train/index.html)
at Texas A&M University.  While there I was embeded in a cancer nutrition wet lab helping
biology postdocs and graduate students analyze their data while learning about the
biology, genetics, and experimental tools that produced it.
From simple ANOVA experimental design, I moved onto "large p small n" settings (i.e., transcriptomics),
and then metagenomics which provided my introduction and eventual transition to nextgen sequencing.
The basis and foundation of my ability to work in and contribute to
[scientific research](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications)
was formed though my outstanding postodoral experience.


## Duke 

Graduate School was an amazing opportunity for me.
Through my steady commitment in college I managed to make a path into
one of the most prestigious statistical departments in the country at [Duke University](http://gardens.duke.edu)
were I complete a [PhD in Statistics](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications).
[Duke's](https://stat.duke.edu) program focussed on Bayesian Analysis, which made for a distinctly different educational experience
than a "Classical Statistics" program. Bayesian Inference provides the capability to model complex
data generation mechansims, and so the focus of the program was specialty and customized hierarchical modeling
of uncertainty as opposed to a general survey of statistical methods and techniques. 
Bayesian Inference relies on sampling from posterior distribution which has historically been
somewhat of a barrier to its general adoption, but recent developments in
[probabilitistic programming tools](http://pymcmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
and general posterior sampling agorithms such as the 
[No U-Turn Sampler](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/nuts.pdf)
have served to greatly democratize Bayesian Analysis and facilitate its accessibility
use outside of specialized academic communities.
