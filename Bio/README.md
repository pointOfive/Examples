## NYC

Last year I embarked on an exciting adventure/career opportunity by moving to NYC.
The energy and diversity (read, people) of this city are amazing,
and my experience here has confirmed that the sense of pacing and life 
in cities provides a very vibrant and motivating ingredient for me in my life.
On the other hand, there's a great sense of peace and accomplishment to be found
in nature. And as such, I've really enjoyed living close to [Central Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Central+Park/@40.7438632,-74.0175455,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2589a018531e3:0xb9df1f7387a94119!8m2!3d40.7828647!4d-73.9653551) on a quiet(er)
[Upper West Side](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7851626,-73.9739507,14z) street (near
[Zabars](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zabar's/@40.7848188,-73.984094,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258862e7ae59b:0x161b26b78af02870!8m2!3d40.7848148!4d-73.9797113),
the [AMNH](https://www.google.com/maps/place/American+Museum+of+Natural+History/@40.7802558,-73.9829629,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f4b00f7a09:0xa27d8172624c5db1!8m2!3d40.7813241!4d-73.9739882), and
[Riverside Park](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8027274,-73.9705007,14z)).
Aside from Central Park (which is obviously the best thing a city ever did for itself) I am
unendingly impressed with the efficieny of the [Subway System](http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html) in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City).
(this characteristic, however, appears to quite clearly distinguish me as being "not from here").
I am very appreciative of the opportunity I've had to live in, explore, and enjoy this unique city.


## ATX

The opportunity to come to NYC materialized because I had spent the previous year or so
extending my [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#hpc) skill set
into a [Data Science](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures) skill set.
Despite having a [PhD in Statistics](https://stat.duke.edu/people/scott-l-schwartz) and working in
[data analysis](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications),
much of the modern data analysis toolset, (e.g., [Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Classification, Big Data, Recommender Systems, Dimensionality Reduction, NLP, etc.](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures#lecture-material))
was new(ish) to me.  But picking up these tools never felt "hard" or "foreign" -- they're very comfortable and seemless extensions of my skill set.
Actually, coming back to [scripting and coding](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Code),
[organizing data processing environments](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#aws-ec2emrs3) and
[modeling and analyzing data](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Examples) just felt like returning to my roots -- it was comfortable, exciting, and
nice to be home where I belonged.

## UT

Living in Austin was nice.  It's an easy city to be healthy in -- there's
nice neighborhoods, fun [running paths](http://www.mountainbiketx.com/downloads/texas/maps/Shoal_Creek.pdf), and I always swam several times a week at the
natural spring [pools](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deep+Eddy+Municipal+Pool/@30.2742588,-97.7777817,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644b546480d4c9f:0x36e8599164fc2421!8m2!3d30.276515!4d-97.7732058).
I moved to Austin to be a part of a [Switchgrass (Biofuel Crop) Breeding Program](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/juenger_lab/home)
at the [University of Texas](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu)
I wanted to be a part of, and contribute to a long term research program.
At UT I was a part of an increadibly strong team of postdocs and graduate students with very diverse backgrounds ranging from 
molecular biology, ecology, botony, plant physiology, and field managers to myself (who provided
[Bioinformatic](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#open-source-tools) and
[Statistical](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Papers#publications) support to the lab).
The combined expertise in the lab comprised a molecular marker based breeding program
with tens of field sites ranging from Mexico to Illinois and 
explored the GxE interactions of plant ecotypes versus environmental conditions.

## Growing Up

and the sense of excitement these
things have brought to my own adventure here.
