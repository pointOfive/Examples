# Welcome

I am a formally trained Bayesian statistician,
have worked extensively in bioinformatics pipelines,
and am fully fluent in the modern data science toolkit.
On this site you will find some [example projects](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Data),
[coding challenges](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Code#coding),
and [computational framework notes](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#computing).

In addition, you will also find my 
- [data science lecture material](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Lectures#lecture-material)
- [informal](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Bio#about) and [formal](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Experience#experience) work history
- and [publication record](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Publications#publications)

Finally, my formal resume is available [here](SchwartzCV.pdf).
