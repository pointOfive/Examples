# Welcome

I am a formally trained Bayesian statistician
currently working on
[Bayesian Neural Networks using TensorFlow](https://github.com/pointOfive/Home/tree/master/Analysis/Projects/TF_K_P#tensorflow--keras)
and [multivariate hierarchical models using PyMC](https://github.com/pointOfive/Home/tree/master/Analysis/Projects/PyMC#pymc-examples).
In the past I have taught data science immersives leveraging the 
sklearn toolkit and have worked extensively on bioinformatics pipelines.
While the two links above provide access to my most recent work,
this site additionally houses
- [data analysis examples](https://github.com/pointOfive/Home/tree/master/Analysis#data-analysis-with-python)
- [programming challenges](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Code#coding)
- [computational framework notes](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Compute#computing)

as well as 
- [data science lecture material](https://github.com/pointOfive/Lectures#lecture-material)
- [work history](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Experience#work-experience) and [bio](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Bio#about)
- [publication record](https://github.com/pointOfive/Examples/tree/master/Publications#publications)

and my formal resume/CV, which is available [here](schwartz2020_.pdf).
